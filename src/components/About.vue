      <p>I'm an ambitious and personable individual with experience in both customer service and software development. I'm currently based in Skipton and work on safeguarding software in schools. I enjoy travelling and my hobbies include cycling and canoeing. As a self-driven, forward-thinking individual, I constantly strive to embrace new techniques and technologies, understanding their impact and weaving them into new and existing projects alike. This has armed me with a vast array of tools, ensuring I am always prepared for the task at hand.</p>
