      <h3>Keighley Laboratories - Analytical Chemist</h3>
      <p>Whilst working here I helped improve general IT procedures as well as managing the company's CMS. I analysed Ferrous and Non-Ferrous materials to find out their chemical composition using wet chemistry techniques and machines such as the ICP (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer) and AA (Atomic absorption spectroscopy). It was here where I developed my passion for IT and decided to go down the apprenticeship route to get in to the IT sector.</p>
