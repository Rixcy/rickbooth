      <h3>CPOMS - Software Developer</h3>
      <p>After working on several smaller projects I moved on to software development full time. Working in a small development team on a rapidly growing Ruby on Rails product, I get to work on several interesting features and bring both internal and customer-based suggestions to life. In this role I get exposure to several frameworks/languages, including Ruby, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, Git, SQL.</p>
