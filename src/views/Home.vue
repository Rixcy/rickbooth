          <div class="content">
            <p>I'm an ambitious and personable individual with experience in both customer service and software development. I'm currently based in Skipton and work on safeguarding software in schools. I enjoy travelling and my hobbies include cycling and canoeing. As a self-driven, forward-thinking individual, I constantly strive to embrace new techniques and technologies, understanding their impact and weaving them into new and existing projects alike. This has armed me with a vast array of tools, ensuring I am always prepared for the task at hand.</p>

              <h3>Keighley Laboratories - Analytical Chemist</h3>
              <p>Whilst working here I helped improve general IT procedures as well as managing the company's CMS. I analysed Ferrous and Non-Ferrous materials to find out their chemical composition using wet chemistry techniques and machines such as the ICP (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer) and AA (Atomic absorption spectroscopy). It was here where I developed my passion for IT and decided to go down the apprenticeship route to get in to the IT sector.</p>
